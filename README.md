# Lost Ark Elixir Patcher

This is a simple tool to patch out the animations from cutting Elixirs. Technically, I've also removed the photosensitive seizure warnings and other related startup movies. All you need to do is select your EFGame folder and the program will make a backup of your file and fetch the modded version of the data1.lpk from this repository. I will try to update this regularly, as occasionally the game will replace the file through patches.

[You can download the patcher here and click on the .exe file.](https://github.com/Poyoanon/loa-elixir-patcher/releases)

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This file _MODIFIES_ the game, which is **against Amazon Game Studio's Terms of Service**. This does not alter anything else regarding elixirs. It merely removes the waiting time for the elixir animations.

Special thanks to spiritovod for his Lost Ark QuickBMS scripts.
