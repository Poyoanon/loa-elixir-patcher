# Lost Ark Elixir Patcher

This is a simple tool to patch out the animations from cutting Elixirs. All you need to do is select your EFGame folder and the program will make a backup of your file and fetch the modded version of the data1.lpk from this repository. I will try to update this regularly, as occasionally the game will replace the file through patches.

10/7 Maintenance - Still works! 
NOTE: Next week (Solo Raid patch) will BREAK elixir fix files. Please be patient until I update the fix when that happens.
As a point of reference, only MAJOR patches will break the elixir patch. It will still work as intended otherwise after non-update maintenances.

**Make sure your game is closed when patching the files!**

[You can download the patcher here and click on the .exe file.](https://github.com/Poyoanon/loa-elixir-patcher/releases)

### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

This file _MODIFIES_ the game, which is **against Amazon Game Studio's Terms of Service**. This does not alter anything else regarding elixirs. It merely removes the waiting time for the elixir animations.

Special thanks to spiritovod for his Lost Ark QuickBMS scripts.

If you'd like to support me in some way for some _ungodly_ reason you can do so [here.](https://ko-fi.com/poyoanon) The files will ALWAYS be free and will never be paywalled.
